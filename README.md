# FINSIGHT-A-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
The primary goal of this project is to provide a data-driven solution that assists financial  institutions in making informed credit decisions. The system offers an intuitive user  interface where users can input customer-specific data, and the model will generate a  prediction result — “Default” or “No Default.”
